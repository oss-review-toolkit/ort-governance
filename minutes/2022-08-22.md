## Attendees

@fviernau, @MarcelBochtler, @mnonnenmacher, @sschuberth, @tsteenbe

## NOTICE file and copyright change

- New files will be created with the new copyright header, see https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort-governance/issues/6#issuecomment-1173522852.
- Existing files should not be updated using the new copyright header. This will be done by Sebastian in one big change.

## Marketing & Website

- Thomas is working on an ORT website with Marcel Kurzmann (@mkurzman) and Kerstin Sonnenholzer from Bosch.IO.
- Currently mainly the flow of information is being discussed.
- The current decisions are documented in ORT's OneDrive.
- The main goal is to have a clear communication about ORT's functionality and to help users to find information faster.
- The first step will be to have a public GitHub organization `README.md` within the [.github](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/.github) repository.

## ORT Server

Marcel and Martin updated the TSC about the current efforts of Bosch.IO regarding the ORT server (see https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/issues/4688).

- Experiments are being done using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [KEDA](https://keda.sh) as an auto-scaler.
- The plans are to make the server cloud agnostic.
- There are internal discussions within Bosch.IO to open-source the ORT server.
- Database schema was created.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) is the main targeted database.
- [KTor](https://ktor.io) is being used as a server application framework.
- [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) is being used as an ORM framework.
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) is being used as an authentication service.

### Timeline

Bosch.IO's plan is to have a working POC at the end of September 2022.

### Non-Scope of the ORT server POC

- Dependency graph for remaining package managers will not be implemented.
- Package analysis and scanning won't be parallelized any more than it is already being done in the ORT CLI.

## ORT developer meeting

Thomas proposes to make this meeting a "rotating host meeting" with the following roles:

### Facilitator

- Moderator of the meeting.

### Scribe

- Create meeting minutes.

### Crier

- Announce the meeting, e.g. in Slack.
- Encourage community members to propose community topics.
- Can be anybody of the community.

Goals:
- Better knowledge sharing between the hosts.
- Different hosts might result in a healthier community meeting as another host might encourage the community to be more involved.

Sebastian remembers the TSC that this is a _developer_ meeting, the meeting should focus on technical topics.

#### Decision

The TSC agrees to implement this meeting structure, with a Facilitator and a Scribe, but without a Crier for now.

## Office hours community meeting

Thomas proposes to create a separate user facing meeting.

### Goals:

- Involve more ORT users to join community meetings.
- Incorrect assumptions of ORT's functionality can be corrected.
- Concentrate on the usage of ORT, as opposed to the development of ORT in the developer meeting.
- Community building.

### Frequency

The ORT office hours should be held monthly.

## Activate GitHub discussions

Before activating GitHub discussions, it has to be documented for the ORT users to decide when to create issues, discussion or ask on Slack.

## Action points

- [Pull request for meeting minutes of TSC meeting on 2020-08-05](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort-governance/pull/26) needs to be merged. Thomas will have a look.
- Frank and Thomas will review [the pull request](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/pull/5472) regarding the NOTICE file.
- Thomas will update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include the copyright change.
- Sebastian will update the existing copyright headers without an E.T.A.
- Thomas will create a proposal for the documentation about issues, discussions and Slack.

## Next TSC meeting

The date for the next TSC meeting will be decided in Slack. Marcel agrees that it is ok for him to not take part if the meeting is during his vacation (Sep. 19 - Sep. 30).
