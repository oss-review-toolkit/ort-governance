## Agenda

### Python Inspector and NuGet Inspector

#### Current status

- Issues are opened in ORT that are caused by the 3rd party projects Python Inspector and Nuget Inspector [1] [2] [3].
- Issues and pull requests are often not answered by the maintainers of these projects [4] [5], even after multiple pings on their Slack channel.
- There has been next to no progress on these projects for months [6].
- ORT community members have forked both tools and use their private forks with ORT.
- No progress was being made with the proposed governance changes and the addition of more maintainers as announced in the TSC meeting on 2025-10-14 and 2025-11-04 [7] [8].

#### Possible solutions

1. The ORT maintainers could take over the maintainance of the inspectors.
2. ORT could fork the inspectors, fix the open upstream issues and incorporate the open PRs into the fork.
3. We may implement the NuGet and Python analysis in ORT itself, e.g. by using tools like Microsoft's component-detection [9] for NuGet projects.

#### Caveats with the solutions

Re 1 and 2: The ORT maintainers cannot commit enough time to maintain two additional projects properly to include bug fixes, new features and support requests by the respective communities.
Re 3: Implementing the analysis in ORT itself would require significant development effort and maintenance resources.

#### Decision

The long term plan is to implement the analyzers into ORT's Kotlin code. This will have the benefit that the ORT maintainers can guarantee that Python and NuGet projects are correctly analyzed and issues with these package managers when analyzed with ORT can be fixed in a timely manner.

Due to time constraints re-implementing these analyzers cannot be done in the short term.
Therefore the short term plan is to create a soft fork of the projects and fix the most pressing issues with them when used with ORT in the existing code.
